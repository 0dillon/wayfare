// DefaultCacheTTL is how long a fetched rate is reused.
//
// One hour, chosen against two facts. Both providers publish roughly daily, so
// an hour never serves a rate the upstream has meaningfully moved past. And a
// single ladder is twelve Quote calls that would otherwise each fetch the same
// mid — a burst of identical requests that can exhaust a free-tier quota in
// one page view.
//
// It is deliberately far shorter than the publishing cadence. The cache exists
// to collapse a burst, not to avoid refetching: a monitor running every few
// hours should still see a fresh rate on every run.
const DefaultCacheTTL = time.Hour

// Cached memoises a provider for a bounded time.
//
// # Why a cached rate is allowed at all
//
// The project's rule is that no rate is displayed unless it came from a live
// source. A cached rate did come from a live source — the question is only
// whether it is still current. So the rule this implements is narrower and
// checkable: a cached rate is served only inside a documented age bound, and
// the age is carried to the caller rather than hidden.
//
// What is never allowed is serving a rate past its bound because a refetch
// failed. That would present a stale figure as current, which is the one thing
// the invariant exists to prevent. A miss plus a failing provider is an error.
//
// # Concurrency
//
// route.Engine.Ladder prices four sizes at once, so this is the read path
// under genuine concurrency. Misses for the same pair collapse into one
// upstream fetch: without that, the first ladder after every expiry would fire
// four simultaneous requests for the same number, which is exactly the burst
// the cache is meant to remove.
